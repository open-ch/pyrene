## Contributing

Thanks a lot for thinking about contributing to pyrene. Any contributions (code, review, ideas, bug reports) are very welcome.

We understand that there can be a certain resistance to contribute to a large existing project like pyrene. But don't worry, we're friendly people and we encourage you to take the plunge.

### Found a security vulnerability?

Please see our [security policy](SECURITY.md).

### Found a bug?

Please open an issue and describe the problem as clearly as possible.

### Fixed a bug?

Even better! Please open a pull request with your fix. See [Code Contributions](#code-contributions) below.

### Have an idea or suggestion for improvement?

Great! Please have a look at the _Principles_ secion on <https://open-ch.github.io/pyrene/>. Unlike most existing component libraries, in many cases we value consistency higher than flexibility. Therefore, we often carefully evaluate whether a specific feature or option is really necessary.

Please also understand that there are a lot of things to consider, like consistency, backwards compatibility, future extensibility. Join us in the discussion to balance those requirements.

Feel free to describe your idea in an issue, or to implement a proof of concept in a pull request. If you open a pull request, see [Code Contributions](#code-contributions) below.

### Have an idea for a new component?

Awesome! Please raise the idea in an issue and let's discuss specifics.

### Code Contributions

Rather than defining strict branch naming, commit message or pull request description rules, we want to be open and flexible. We only ask you to use common sense and to be open to suggestions.

Of course, there are some code style and formatting rules we're following. Pull request checks will remind you of those. To catch issues early, make sure to run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` in the respective subproject.

### Let's go

Have a look at [DEVELOPMENT.md](pyrene/DEVELOPMENT.md) for some technical hints to get you started.
