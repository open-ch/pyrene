# pyrene
Open Systems Component Library

## Development

For development on pyrene, we recommend to use it together with [Kitchen Sink](/browse), follow the steps there.

## Release

### Feature Releases

For new features and breaking changes, always use a major version bump (for the time being we use minor versions `1.x`).

Always do feature releases from `develop`.

### Bugfix Versions

For bugfixes use bugfix versions, for a bugfix of `1.2.3`, use `1.2.4`.

We do bugfix releases from `release/` branches.

```bash
yarn release
```
